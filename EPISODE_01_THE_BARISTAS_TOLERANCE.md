## COLD OPEN: HOW DEREK DISCOVERED THE PERCOLATOR

**INT. THE PERCOLATOR COFFEE SHOP - THREE MONTHS AGO - 6:47 AM**

*The coffee shop is empty. Too early for tourists. Too late for fishermen. The rain hasn't started yet but it will. It always does.*

*The door opens. DEREK enters. Ducks. The doorframe scrapes the top of his head anyway. He's 8'2". Doorframes are aspirational.*

*LINDA (42, barista, seen some shit) looks up from wiping the counter. Pauses. Stares. Her hand keeps moving in circles. The rag squeaks against the laminate.*

*Ten seconds pass.*

*Derek stands in the doorway. Waiting. Polite.*

**LINDA:**  
(flat, exhausted, unfazed)  
We open at seven.

**DEREK:**  
(deep voice, careful articulation)  
Your sign says six-thirty.

*Linda looks at the door. The sign does say 6:30 AM. She makes a noise. Not quite a sigh. Not quite acceptance. Something in between.*

**LINDA:** Fine. What do you want?

*Derek approaches the counter. Each step is careful. He's learned to move gently. Things break when you're 600 pounds. Things break when you exist wrong.*

**DEREK:** Coffee.

**LINDA:** What kind?

*Derek reaches into his jacket. Pulls out an ancient coffee cup. Gas station logo. Faded. Stained. From 1987. He places it on the counter gently.*

**DEREK:** This kind.

*Linda stares at the cup. The cup stares back. It has seen things.*

**LINDA:** Sir, that's... I can't... that's a biohazard.

**DEREK:** It's just old coffee.

**LINDA:** How old?

**DEREK:** Nineteen eighty-seven.

**[PAUSE: 8 seconds]**

**LINDA:** You want me to put fresh coffee. In your cup. From nineteen eighty-seven.

**DEREK:** I'll pay for a large. You can keep the cup if you want. I mean... you can keep your cup. This is my cup. I want to keep this cup. But I'll pay for—

**LINDA:**  
(cutting him off, too tired for this)  
I don't want the cup. I'll give you hot water. Free. You put it in your nightmare mug. We never speak of this again.

**DEREK:** Hot water is coffee?

**LINDA:** Not even close. But neither is whatever that is.

*She points at the cup. The cup does not respond. It has transcended response.*

*Derek considers this. Nods. This is acceptable. This is logical. This is why he likes Linda.*

**DEREK:** Deal.

*Linda pours hot water into his ancient cup. The water meets the residue of 37-year-old coffee. Something happens. Chemistry. Or alchemy. The water turns dark immediately.*

**LINDA:**  
(horrified fascination)  
Oh my god.

**DEREK:** It does that.

**LINDA:** That should not happen.

**DEREK:** And yet.

*Derek picks up the cup. Nods. Turns to leave.*

**LINDA:** Wait.

*He stops. Turns back.*

**LINDA (CONT'D):** You're Sasquatch.

**DEREK:** I prefer Derek.

**LINDA:** Your name is Derek?

**DEREK:** Yes.

**LINDA:** Sasquatch Derek.

**DEREK:** Just Derek. The Sasquatch part is... descriptive. Not a title.

**LINDA:** Okay. Derek. Why are you in Ocean Shores?

**DEREK:** I saw a sign.

**LINDA:** What sign?

**DEREK:** Come As You Are.

*[PAUSE: 5 seconds]*

**LINDA:**  
(realizing)  
The Kurt Cobain memorial sign? On the highway?

**DEREK:**  
(nodding)  
I've been hiding for two hundred years. I thought... maybe it was time. The sign said Come As You Are. So I came. As I am.

**[PAUSE: 7 seconds]**

*Linda stares. The espresso machine hums. The rain starts. First drops on the window. Right on schedule.*

**LINDA:**  
(quiet, almost kind)  
Well. Here you are.

**DEREK:** Here I am.

**[PAUSE: 4 seconds]**

**DEREK (CONT'D):** May I ask you questions? About humans?

**LINDA:** What?

**DEREK:** I'm studying anthropology. Human behavior. I observe but I don't understand. May I interview you?

**LINDA:** Interview me?

**DEREK:** Yes. About being human. About living here. About... this.

*He gestures vaguely at the coffee shop. At Ocean Shores. At existence.*

**LINDA:**  
(laughing, broken, tired)  
About this?

**DEREK:** Yes.

**LINDA:** You want to interview me. About being human. In Ocean Shores. Where I work at a coffee shop. At six-forty-seven in the morning. Serving hot water to Sasquatch.

**DEREK:** If you're willing.

*Linda looks at him. Really looks. He's sincere. Those eyes. Dark. Deep. Genuinely curious. Not mocking. Not judging. Just... asking.*

**LINDA:**  
(defeated, amused)  
Fuck it. Sure. Why not? When?

**DEREK:** Now?

**LINDA:** I'm working.

**DEREK:** I'll wait until you have a break.

**LINDA:** I don't get a break.

**DEREK:** I'll wait until it's slow.

**LINDA:**  
(gesturing at the empty shop)  
This is slow.

**DEREK:** Then... now?

*Linda looks around. Nobody's here. Nobody's coming. It's Ocean Shores in January. This is as busy as it gets.*

**LINDA:**  
(throwing the rag down)  
Fuck it. Let's do this. But I'm standing. My feet hurt.

**DEREK:** Acceptable.

*He pulls out a small recording device. Sets it on the counter. Presses record.*

**DEREK (CONT'D):** Coffee with Sasquatch.

**LINDA:** That's the name?

**DEREK:** Yes.

**LINDA:** That's a terrible name.

**DEREK:** I know.

**LINDA:** Are you going to change it?

**DEREK:** No.

**LINDA:** Then why did you—

**DEREK:** We're starting.

**Classification:** Active Research Session (PILOT EPISODE)  
**Date:** October 12, 2025  
**Location:** The Percolator Coffee Shop, Ocean Shores, WA  
**Subject:** Linda Hargrove, Age 42, Occupation: Barista/Coffee Shop Manager  
**Interview Duration:** 11 minutes, 23 seconds

**Follow-Up Required:** Yes. Weekly visits established.  
**Significance:** First interview. Establishes methodology and tone.

**PRE-INTERVIEW OBSERVATIONS:**

Subject arrived at work at 6:15 AM (15 minutes before opening). Dedication or avoidance? Research required. Subject appears competent, exhausted, and deeply unimpressed by existence. Valuable qualities in a research partner.

Subject accepted interview with minimal resistance. Possible reasons:
1. Too tired to refuse
2. Genuinely curious about cryptid anthropology
3. Ocean Shores has depleted her capacity for surprise
4. All of the above (hypothesis: likely)

Subject did not ask for compensation. Concerning. Will investigate local wage standards.

Subject's coffee shop:
- Clean (meticulous)
- Empty (expected)
- Smells like coffee and resignation (poetic)
- Fourteen motivational posters on walls (ironic?)
- "HANG IN THERE" cat poster prominently displayed (cry for help?)

Subject makes eye contact. Direct. Unflinching. Rare in humans. Appreciated.

Interview begins at 6:52 AM.

## THE INTERVIEW

**INT. THE PERCOLATOR COFFEE SHOP - MORNING**

*Linda stands behind the counter. Arms crossed. Not defensive. Just... that's where her arms go. Default position. Derek sits on a reinforced stool. He called ahead yesterday to ask if they had reinforced seating. Linda said "we have one bar stool that doesn't wobble." This was that stool. It wobbles.*

*The recording device blinks red. On. Off. On. Off.*

**SASQUATCH:** State your name for the record.

**LINDA:** Linda Hargrove.

**SASQUATCH:** Occupation?

**LINDA:** Barista. Manager. Owner. Janitor. Therapist. Whatever needs doing.

**SASQUATCH:** You own this coffee shop?

**LINDA:** Unfortunately.

**SASQUATCH:** That sounds negative.

**LINDA:**  
(dry laugh)  
It is.

**[PAUSE: 3 seconds]**

**SASQUATCH:** Why own a business you don't enjoy?

**LINDA:** Because my ex-husband owned it first. Then he left. Then I got it in the divorce. Then I was stuck.

**SASQUATCH:** Stuck.

**LINDA:** Yeah. Can't sell it. Nobody wants a coffee shop in Ocean Shores. Can't close it. It's my income. Can't burn it down. That's insurance fraud.

**SASQUATCH:** Have you considered insurance fraud?

**LINDA:**  
(pause)  
Daily.

*Derek makes a note in his notebook. Linda watches.*

**LINDA (CONT'D):** Are you seriously taking notes about my arson fantasies?

**SASQUATCH:** Research requires data.

**LINDA:** I was joking.

**SASQUATCH:** Were you?

**[PAUSE: 6 seconds]**

*Linda uncrosses her arms. Re-crosses them. Defensive now. Derek noticed. Shit.*

**LINDA:**  
(quieter)  
Mostly joking.

**SASQUATCH:** Noted.

*He writes something. Linda cranes her neck to see. Can't. His handwriting is surprisingly neat but small. Cryptid penmanship.*

**SASQUATCH (CONT'D):** How long have you lived in Ocean Shores?

**LINDA:** Twelve years.

**SASQUATCH:** By choice?

**LINDA:** Does anyone choose Ocean Shores?

**SASQUATCH:** I did.

**LINDA:** You're Sasquatch. You live in forests. This is a forest. With a Safeway.

**SASQUATCH:** It's not a forest. It's a town.

**LINDA:** Barely.

**SASQUATCH:** But you stay.

**LINDA:**  
(frustrated now)  
Yeah. I stay. Because leaving costs money I don't have. Because starting over sounds exhausting. Because at least here I know where everything is. Even if everything sucks.

**[PAUSE: 5 seconds]**

*Derek stands. The stool groans with relief. He walks away. Four steps. Six steps. Ten steps. Stops by the window. Rain harder now. The coffee cup never wavers in his hand. Perfect balance. 200 years of practice.*

---

### [VISUAL: ANIMATION SEQUENCE]

**DEREK'S INTERNAL MONOLOGUE (V.O.):**

*[Animation style: Simple line drawings, thought-bubble aesthetic]*

*[Visual: A stick figure labeled "LINDA" chained to a tiny building labeled "PERCOLATOR"]*

**DEREK (V.O.):** She's trapped. Not physically. Financially. Emotionally. The coffee shop is an anchor. Or a prison. Or both. Humans have a word for this: commitment. Or is it: suffering? I should check.

*[Visual: The stick figure grows roots into the ground. Becomes a tree. The tree looks sad. Can trees look sad? In animation: yes.]*

**DEREK (V.O., CONT'D):** She could leave. She won't leave. There's a difference between "can't" and "won't" but humans use them interchangeably. Why?

*[Visual: Two doors. One labeled "CAN'T" (locked, padlock). One labeled "WON'T" (unlocked, but covered in spiderwebs and warning signs).]*

**DEREK (V.O., CONT'D):** The "can't" door is locked by external forces. Money. Logistics. Reality. The "won't" door is locked by internal forces. Fear. Exhaustion. The comfort of familiar suffering.

*[Visual: Linda standing between both doors, arms crossed, not moving.]*

**DEREK (V.O., CONT'D):** She chose the "won't" door. But she calls it "can't." This is called... what? Self-deception? Protection? Narrative simplification? All three?

*[Derek's thought bubble shows himself trying to open the "won't" door. It opens easily. Linda stares at it, terrified.]*

**DEREK (V.O., CONT'D):** Maybe I shouldn't open doors people aren't ready to walk through.

*[Visual: Derek drinking his cold coffee. Realizes he's in his own thought bubble. Looks confused. The animation becomes recursive - thought bubbles within thought bubbles.]*

**DEREK (V.O., CONT'D):** I'm overthinking this. Which is ironic. Because I'm literally watching my own thoughts. In my thoughts. Meta-cognition is exhausting.

*[The recursive thought bubbles collapse. We're back in the coffee shop.]*

---

### [RETURN TO INTERVIEW]

*Derek walks back to the counter. Sits. The stool groans. Linda has been standing in silence for 52 seconds. She's used to silence. This is different silence. This silence has questions in it.*

**SASQUATCH:** What do you want?

**LINDA:** What?

**SASQUATCH:** If you could leave. If money wasn't a factor. If exhaustion wasn't a factor. What would you want?

**[PAUSE: 9 seconds]**

*Linda's arms stay crossed. Her jaw tightens. She looks at the espresso machine. The posters. The empty tables. The rain. Anywhere but Derek.*

**LINDA:**  
(whispered)  
I don't know.

**SASQUATCH:** You don't know? Or you're afraid to say?

**[PAUSE: 7 seconds]**

**LINDA:**  
(louder, defensive)  
What difference does it make? I'm here. I'm staying here. Wanting something else doesn't change that.

**SASQUATCH:** But you do want something else.

**LINDA:** I didn't say that.

**SASQUATCH:** You didn't have to.

*Linda's arms drop. She grips the counter edge. Knuckles white.*

**LINDA:**  
(quiet, cracking)  
I used to want to be a teacher. Elementary school. Third grade. I liked third graders. They're old enough to be funny but young enough to think you're smart.

**SASQUATCH:** Why didn't you become a teacher?

**LINDA:** Because I got married at twenty-two. Because he wanted to move here. Because we bought this place. Because I was going to take classes online. Because that never happened. Because then twelve years passed and now I'm forty-two and it's too late.

**SASQUATCH:** Too late for what?

**LINDA:**  
(laughing, bitter)  
For everything. For teaching. For starting over. For wanting things.

**[PAUSE: 11 seconds - the longest pause so far]**

*This pause is critical. Linda's breathing is audible. The espresso machine hums. The rain intensifies. Derek doesn't blink. The recording device blinks for both of them. Red. Red. Red.*

**SASQUATCH:** You're forty-two. Not dead.

**LINDA:** Might as well be.

**SASQUATCH:** That's dramatic.

**LINDA:**  
(angry now, sudden)  
You asked. I answered. You want me to be all hopeful? All "it's never too late"? Fuck that. You know what's never too late? Death. That's literally the one thing that waits. Everything else? There's a window. And mine closed.

*Derek pulls out his notebook. Writes something. Linda watches him write. Her anger holds. Then falters. Then collapses.*

**LINDA (CONT'D):**  
(quieter)  
Sorry. That was harsh.

**SASQUATCH:** That was honest.

**LINDA:** Same thing sometimes.

**SASQUATCH:**  
(looking up from notebook)  
Yes. It is.

*They look at each other. Understanding passes between them. Two creatures who don't lie. Who can't lie. Who only have honesty and it hurts.*

**SASQUATCH (CONT'D):** Thank you for your honesty.

**LINDA:** Thank you for asking.

**[PAUSE: 4 seconds]**

**LINDA (CONT'D):** Are we done?

**SASQUATCH:** One more question.

*Linda nods. Braces.*

**SASQUATCH (CONT'D):** Why did you say yes to this interview?

**LINDA:**  
(thinking)  
Because... nobody asks me questions. Customers order. My ex yelled. My mom lectures. But nobody... asks. Like, really asks. Like they want to know. You wanted to know.

**SASQUATCH:** I did. I do.

**LINDA:** Why?

**SASQUATCH:** Because I don't understand humans. And you're human. And you're here. And you said yes.

**LINDA:**  
(laughing, real this time)  
That's the saddest research methodology I've ever heard.

**SASQUATCH:** Is it working?

**LINDA:**  
(thinking)  
Yeah. Actually. It is.

*The timer on Derek's phone dings. Soft. Final.*

**SASQUATCH:** We're out of time.

**LINDA:** That was eleven minutes?

**SASQUATCH:** Eleven minutes, twenty-three seconds.

**LINDA:** Felt longer.

**SASQUATCH:** Good conversations do.

**LINDA:** Was that good?

**SASQUATCH:** I learned things. Did you?

**[PAUSE: 5 seconds]**

**LINDA:**  
(quiet)  
Yeah. I think I did.

*Derek stands. Picks up his recorder. His ancient coffee cup. Linda watches him.*

**LINDA (CONT'D):** Are you coming back?

**SASQUATCH:** May I?

**LINDA:** You want to interview more people?

**SASQUATCH:** Yes. Weekly. If possible. Different citizens. Different questions. Same format. I'll pay for the space. And your time.

**LINDA:** You don't have to pay me.

**SASQUATCH:** You're providing location and context. That's labor. Labor deserves compensation.

**LINDA:**  
(surprised)  
Oh. Okay. Um. Fifty bucks per interview?

**SASQUATCH:** One hundred.

**LINDA:** That's too much.

**SASQUATCH:** I've been saving since eighteen-twenty-four. I have money. You need money. This is called exchange. Capitalism. I read about it.

**LINDA:**  
(laughing, crying a little)  
You're very literal, aren't you?

**SASQUATCH:** Yes.

**LINDA:** That must be hard.

**SASQUATCH:** Sometimes.

**LINDA:** Me too.

*They look at each other again. Recognition. Two literalists in a metaphorical world.*

**SASQUATCH:** See you next week?

**LINDA:** Yeah. Next week.

*Derek walks to the door. Stops. Turns back.*

**SASQUATCH:** Linda?

**LINDA:** Yeah?

**SASQUATCH:** It's not too late. The window isn't closed. You just think it is. There's a difference.

*Linda opens her mouth. Closes it. No words.*

*Derek leaves. The bell chimes. The rain gets louder. Then muffled. Then just background.*

*Linda stands alone behind the counter. Stares at nothing. Thinks.*

*Twelve minutes later, she googles: "online teaching certification Washington state."*

*She doesn't click anything. Not yet. But she looks.*

*That's something.*

## FIELD NOTES #001: POST-INTERVIEW ANALYSIS

**Initial Assessment:** Subject presented as exhausted, resigned, competent. Classic "surviving not thriving" archetype. Defended position (coffee shop ownership) while simultaneously expressing desire to escape. Cognitive dissonance evident.

**Breaking Point:** Question about wanting. Subject had not articulated desires in significant time period. Articulation led to emotional response. Tears observed. Subject apologized for tears. Unnecessary apology. Sadness is data, not failure.

**Observable Behavioral Changes:**
- Vocal tone: Flat/Sarcastic → Defensive → Honest/Vulnerable → Hopeful(?)
- Body language: Crossed arms throughout → Grip counter → Relaxed slightly at end
- Eye contact: Direct (maintained) → Avoidant (when discussing ex-husband) → Direct again (end of interview)
- Speech patterns: Sarcastic → Angry → Quiet/Real

**Key Quote:** "You know what's never too late? Death. That's literally the one thing that waits. Everything else? There's a window. And mine closed."
- Subject believes opportunity has time limits
- Subject believes she exceeded her limits
- Subject is wrong (window remains open; evidence: still alive, still capable)
- Did not say this directly (seemed cruel)
- Implied instead (gentler approach)

**Post-Interview Behavior:**
- Returned to work (expected)
- Seemed thoughtful (unexpected)
- Searched for teaching certification (observed through window, possibly ethical violation, will consider later)
- Did not close laptop for 8 minutes after search (processing)

**Hypothesis:** Humans trap themselves with narratives. "Too late." "Can't." "Stuck." These are stories, not facts. But humans believe stories more than facts. Why?

**Evidence:**
1. Linda physically able to leave (legs work)
2. Linda financially able to leave (could sell business at loss, move, start over)
3. Linda emotionally unable to leave (fear, exhaustion, familiar suffering preferred over unknown suffering)
4. Linda calls emotional inability "financial inability" (self-protection through misattribution)

**Conclusion:** Asking humans what they want is cruel. Because they've spent years not asking themselves. My question was a mirror. Mirrors are weapons. I should be more careful. Or should I? Research requires honesty. Honesty causes pain. Is pain necessary for growth? Or just pain? Monitor this.

**Question for Future Research:** Am I helping or harming? Is there a difference if the result is awareness? Does awareness without agency equal suffering? Should I stop asking questions?

**Answer:** No. Questions are the project. Discomfort is part of data collection. Linda consented. Consent matters. Continue.

**Emotional Status:** Uncertain. Possible guilt. Possible satisfaction. Both uncomfortable. Will process with therapist.

**Coffee Temperature:** 52°F. Optimal for room temperature beverage that serves as emotional support object rather than consumable.

**Recommendation:** Return next week. Interview different citizen. Establish pattern. Give Linda space to process.

**Next Subject:** Tom the Librarian. (He already knows. He's been watching me take notes at the library for weeks. He's prepared. This will be different.)

## EXCERPT FROM DEREK'S PERSONAL JOURNAL  
(Not for publication, included because Linda said "be honest")

*Date: October 12, 2025, 11:34 PM*

First interview complete.

I made Linda cry.

Not intentionally. But also... maybe intentionally? I asked about wanting. People don't ask Linda about wanting. They ask what she offers. What she provides. What she serves. Coffee. Space. Labor. Empathy.

Nobody asks what she wants.

So I asked.

And she cried.

And I learned.

But at what cost?

Tom says this is valuable work. "Anthropology requires intimate observation," he said. "You're doing what anthropologists do. You're seeing people."

But anthropologists usually have ethical review boards. And research grants. And institutional oversight.

I have a recording device from Best Buy and a coffee cup from 1987.

Is this rigorous? Or am I just lonely and calling it science?

Linda googled teaching programs after I left. I saw her through the window. I shouldn't have watched. That was invasive. But I did watch. Because I wanted to know: did my question plant something? Or just expose something that was already there?

Does it matter?

She looked at that screen for eight minutes. Didn't click. But looked.

That's something.

Maybe that's everything.

Maybe my job isn't to fix anything. Maybe my job is to ask. And the asking itself does something. Opens something. A window Linda thinks is closed.

Or maybe I'm just making myself feel better about making someone cry in their own coffee shop at seven AM on a Tuesday.

I don't know.

What I do know:
1. Linda is intelligent
2. Linda is trapped (possibly self-trapped)
3. Linda is kind (gave me free hot water for disgusting cup)
4. Linda is honest (rare)
5. Linda is reconsidering her narrative

That last one is the important one.

I came to Ocean Shores because a sign said "Come As You Are." I interpreted that as acceptance. Permission. Welcome.

Linda came to Ocean Shores because a man asked her to. She interpreted that as love. It wasn't.

Now she's here. And I'm here. Two creatures who came for wrong reasons. Staying for unclear reasons.

Anthropology is supposed to be objective. Observer separate from observed. But I'm not separate. I'm here. In the data. In the town. In the coffee shop.

I'm not observing Ocean Shores.

I'm living in it.

That changes everything.

Or nothing.

I don't know yet.

Next week: Tom the Librarian.

He's going to ask me questions. I can already tell. He's that kind of human. The kind that flips interviews. The kind that sees the observer and says "now tell me about YOU."

I'm not ready.

But I said I'd come.

So I'll come.

As I am.

The coffee's getting colder.

It's always getting colder.

Entropy applies to beverages too.

Entropy applies to everything.

That's comforting, somehow.

Everything degrades at the same rate.

Me. The coffee. Linda's dreams. The "Hang In There" poster.

All temporary.

All temporary.

Good night.

## APPENDIX A: VISUAL NOTES FOR ANIMATION

### Key Animated Sequences

**1. COLD OPEN - DEREK'S FIRST ENTRANCE (Timestamp: 0:00-2:14)**
- Derek enters coffee shop (ducking, scraping doorframe)
- Linda's reaction: freeze, stare, keep wiping counter in loop
- Close-up on the ancient coffee cup (zoom in, ominous music)
- Hot water + old coffee residue = alchemy (sparkles? grossness? both)
- "Come As You Are" sign flashback (sepia tone, emotional)

**2. WALK-AWAY #1 - THE PRISON METAPHOR (Timestamp: 6:21)**
- Derek stands, walks to window
- Animation: Linda as stick figure chained to coffee shop

### Character Design Notes - PILOT

**DEREK/SASQUATCH:**
- First appearance: imposing but gentle
- Height emphasized by low camera angles

- Flannel shirt (tarp with arm holes) - visible stitching
- Face: expressive eyes, rest often obscured by fur
- Movement: deliberate, careful (afraid of breaking things)

**THE COFFEE CUP:**
- 1987 gas station logo (make one up)
- Visible stains, patina of age
- Handle slightly cracked but holding

- Never empty, never full, eternal
- Held with reverence

**LINDA:**
- Age 42 (looks tired but capable)
- Barista apron (stained, well-worn)
- Hair in practical bun (no time for fancy)
- Perpetual expression: "are you kidding me"
- Softens during interview
- Default pose: arms crossed OR gripping counter
- Capable hands (worker's hands)

**THE PERCOLATOR COFFEE SHOP:**
- Small (12 tables max)

- Windows: ALWAYS RAIN (exterior shots)
- Lighting: warm but fluorescent (liminal)
- The reinforced stool (Derek's stool) - slightly different color

"SASQUATCH SAW A SIGN.

It said: COME AS YOU ARE.

So he came.

To Ocean Shores, Washington. Population: 6,000. Appropriateness: 0.

Derek (yes, that's his name) is 8'2", two hundred years old, and deeply confused about humans. So he started a project: interview the locals. Ask honest questions. Record everything. Publish the results.

This is anthropology.  
This is comedy.  
This is what happens when you take "Come As You Are" literally.

EPISODE 1: THE BARISTA'S TOLERANCE
Linda owns a coffee shop she doesn't want. Derek asks what she does want. The answer surprises them both.

Coffee with Sasquatch: It all leads to nothing. But there's coffee."
