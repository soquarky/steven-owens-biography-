## PRE-EPISODE: TOM'S PREPARATION

**INT. OCEAN SHORES PUBLIC LIBRARY - TWO DAYS BEFORE INTERVIEW - 3:47 PM**

*The library is quiet. Libraries are always quiet. That's the rule. That's the whole point. Quiet is the product libraries sell. Silence with books.*

*TOM RICHARDSON (38, librarian, anxious, kind) sits at his desk behind the circulation counter. In front of him: a legal pad. On the legal pad: questions. Crossed out questions. Re-written questions. More crossed out questions.*

*He's been working on this for two hours.*

*The pad looks like a war zone.*

**TOM:**  
(muttering to himself)  
Okay. So. Umm. "Why are you interviewing people?" No, that's too direct. Maybe... "What inspired this project?" No, that sounds like a grant application. Umm...

*He crosses out another line. Starts again.*

**TOM (CONT'D):**  
"How do you feel about—" No. No feelings. He's a cryptid. Do cryptids have feelings? That's probably offensive. I should know that. I'm a librarian. I should know everything. That's... that's not realistic. Nobody knows everything. Except maybe—

*The door opens. DEREK enters. Ducks. Always ducks. The doorframe scrapes. Always scrapes.*

*Tom freezes. Flips the legal pad over. Too obvious. Flips it back. Worse. Covers it with a book. The book is titled "BIGFOOT: MYTH OR REALITY?" Even worse.*

**DEREK:**  
(approaching the desk, coffee cup in hand)  
Hello, Tom.

**TOM:**  
(too loud, then too quiet)  
HI. Hi. Hey. Hello. Hi, Derek. How are... how are you today?

**DEREK:** Functional. Are you available for interview this week?

**TOM:**  
(nervous laugh)  
Umm. Yes. Yeah. About that. I was... I was thinking. Maybe. And this is just, like, a thought. But maybe... could I ask YOU some questions? Instead? Or... or also? Both? Could we do both?

**[PAUSE: 5 seconds]**

*Derek tilts his head. Considering. Tom's heart rate increases. Visible. His fingers drum the desk. Anxious rhythm.*

**DEREK:** You want to interview me?

**TOM:**  
(rushing words)  
I mean, not interview. That's your thing. I don't want to step on your thing. But like... questions? About the project? And why you're here? And... and about you? If that's okay? It's totally okay if it's not okay. I just thought—

**DEREK:** Yes.

**TOM:**  
(surprised)  
What?

**DEREK:** Yes. You may ask me questions. Reciprocity is fair. You've been helpful. You deserve answers.

**TOM:**  
(exhaling)  
Oh. Oh good. Great. Umm. When?

**DEREK:** This week. The usual time. The usual place.

**TOM:** The Percolator?

**DEREK:** Yes.

**TOM:** And I can... I can ask anything?

**DEREK:**  
(pause)  
Within reason.

**TOM:** What's reason?

**DEREK:** We'll discover that together.

*Derek nods. Turns to leave. Stops. Turns back.*

**DEREK (CONT'D):** Tom?

**TOM:** Yeah?

**DEREK:** Thank you for asking. Most people just answer. You're the first to ask.

*He leaves. The door closes. Tom stares at his legal pad. At his crossed-out questions. At the book about Bigfoot.*

*He starts writing new questions.*

*These ones are better.*

## FIELD NOTES ENTRY #002
**Classification:** Active Research Session (REVERSED FORMAT)  
**Date:** October 19, 2025  
**Location:** The Percolator Coffee Shop, Ocean Shores, WA  
**Subject:** Interview Methodology Reversal - Derek as Subject  
**Interviewer:** Tom Richardson, Age 38, Occupation: Librarian  
**Interview Duration:** 14 minutes, 12 seconds  
**Coffee Consumed:** 0 ounces (as always)  
**Existential Revelations:** 3 (my own - unexpected)  
**Discomfort Level:** Severe (being observed is different than observing)  
**Verbal Hesitations Counted:** 47 "umms," 23 "uhs," 18 "likes"  
**Post-Interview Behavior:** Subject (me) required 22 minutes alone. Processing.  
**Follow-Up Required:** Yes. Self-examination. Possibly therapy.  
**Significance:** First time answering instead of asking. Uncomfortable. Illuminating.

**PRE-INTERVIEW OBSERVATIONS:**

Tom arrived 11 minutes early. Clutching legal pad. Visible anxiety. Ordered coffee (medium drip, black, simple order suggesting practical personality). Did not drink coffee. Stared at coffee. Coffee stared back. Neither blinked.

Tom's nervous behaviors:
1. Adjusting glasses (17 times in 11 minutes)
2. Tapping pen against pad (rhythmic, self-soothing)
3. Re-reading questions (constant)
4. Apologizing preemptively (3 times before interview began)

I am the subject today. This is new. This is concerning. I observe others. I do not enjoy being observed. Hypocrisy noted. Will examine later.

Linda watching from behind counter. Amused. She knows what's happening. She prepared me: "He's going to be nervous. Be patient. He's a good person." Good person. Interesting qualification. Implies some people are not good. Will explore later.

Interview begins at 10:00 AM.

I am not ready.

We begin anyway.

## THE INTERVIEW

**INT. THE PERCOLATOR COFFEE SHOP - MORNING**

*Rain outside. Always rain. Rain is the default state of Ocean Shores. Sun is the exception. Sun requires explanation.*

*DEREK sits at his usual table. The reinforced one. Tom sits across from him. Legal pad open. Pen ready. Hands shaking slightly. Coffee untouched.*

*Derek's recording device on the table. This time Tom asked if he could record too. Derek said yes. Two devices. Red lights blinking. Synchronized uncertainty.*

**TOM:**  
(clearing throat)  
Okay. So. Umm. Should I... how do you start these?

**DEREK:** You say "Coffee with Sasquatch."

**TOM:** Do I say that? Or do you say that?

**DEREK:** I usually say it. But you're interviewing me. So... unclear.

**TOM:**  
(nervous laugh)  
Right. Okay. Umm. Coffee with... with Sasquatch?

*[He says it like a question. Like he's unsure if that's correct. Derek nods. Permission granted.]*

**TOM (CONT'D):**  
(reading from pad, formal)  
State your name for the record.

**DEREK:** Derek S. Bigfoot.

**TOM:** The S stands for...?

**DEREK:** Sasquatch.

**TOM:** So your name is Derek Sasquatch Bigfoot?

**DEREK:** Yes.

**TOM:**  
(pause, processing)  
That's... umm... that's very literal.

**DEREK:** I'm a literal person.

**TOM:**  
(writing that down)  
Okay. Okay good. Umm. Next question. How old are you?

**DEREK:** Two hundred and one years old. Approximately.

**TOM:** Approximately?

**DEREK:** I didn't track birthdays for the first fifty years. Seemed unnecessary. Later I cross-referenced historical events. Best estimate: two hundred and one.

**TOM:**  
(amazed, anxious)  
Two hundred... okay. That's. Wow. Umm. So you've seen... like... everything?

**DEREK:** Not everything. Many things. Too many things possibly.

**TOM:** Like what?

**DEREK:** That's not one question. That's infinite questions.

**TOM:**  
(flustered)  
Right. Sorry. Umm. Okay. Different question. Why... why did you decide to come to Ocean Shores? Specifically?

**DEREK:** I saw a sign. "Come As You Are."

**TOM:** The Kurt Cobain memorial?

**DEREK:** Yes.

**TOM:** And you... you thought it was for you?

**DEREK:** It didn't specify who it was for. It just said "Come As You Are." So I came. As I am.

**[PAUSE: 6 seconds]**

*Tom writes something. Underlines it. Looks up.*

**TOM:**  
(quieter, curious)  
What did you think it meant? Like... what did you want it to mean?

**[PAUSE: 8 seconds]**

*Derek's turn to pause. This is different. Nobody asks what he wants. He asks what others want. This reversal is disorienting.*

**DEREK:**  
(slower, careful)  
I thought it meant... permission. To stop hiding. To be visible. To exist without pretending.

**TOM:** And does it? Mean that?

**DEREK:** I'm still determining that.

**TOM:**  
(concerned)  
But people... people are okay with you being here? Like, nobody's freaking out?

**DEREK:** Some people stare. Most people adapt. Linda serves me hot water. You let me sit in the library for hours. The grocery store cashier stopped asking for ID. Adaptation is impressive.

**TOM:**  
(smiling a little)  
Yeah. Ocean Shores is... we're pretty weird-friendly.

**DEREK:** Why?

**TOM:** Why what?

**DEREK:** Why is Ocean Shores weird-friendly?

**TOM:**  
(thinking, lots of umms)  
Umm. I guess... because everyone here is kind of... running from something? Or toward something? Or just... ended up here and stayed? It's not a destination. It's a... a landing place. For people who don't fit other places. So when a Sasquatch shows up, it's like... yeah. That tracks. Welcome to the island of misfit toys.

*Derek writes in his notebook. First time he's taken notes during one of these. Tom notices. Looks proud. Anxious-proud.*

**TOM (CONT'D):**  
(emboldened)  
Can I... can I ask why you're doing this? The interview project?

**DEREK:** You just did ask.

**TOM:** No, I mean, can I ask and will you answer?

**DEREK:** Try it and see.

**TOM:**  
(reading from pad again)  
Why are you interviewing people? What's the goal? Like... what are you hoping to learn?

*Derek stands. The chair groans. Tom startles. Looks worried. Did he mess up? Is the interview over?*

**DEREK:** Continuing. Just thinking.

*He walks away. Coffee cup in hand. Perfect balance. Walks to the window. Rain streams down. He stares through rain. Through window. Through time.*

---

### [VISUAL: ANIMATION SEQUENCE]

**DEREK'S INTERNAL MONOLOGUE (V.O.):**

*[Animation style: Simple line drawings, more introspective than previous episode]*

*[Visual: Young Derek (still 8'2", but somehow younger) hiding in forest, watching humans from distance]*

**DEREK (V.O.):** I've been watching humans for two hundred years. From far away. Through trees. Across clearings. I watched them build. Fight. Love. Die. I watched them be... human.

*[Visual: Timeline of human moments - wars, weddings, funerals, births - Derek always in the background, hidden, watching]*

**DEREK (V.O., CONT'D):** But watching isn't understanding. I collected data. Observations. Patterns. But not understanding. You can watch rain for a hundred years and never understand what water thinks. If water thinks. Does it?

*[Visual: Rain drops forming question marks, falling into puddle labeled "UNDERSTANDING"]*

**DEREK (V.O., CONT'D):** So I decided: ask. Don't watch. Ask. Talk to them. Not at them. With them. If I want to understand humans, I need to... participate. Carefully. With permission. With structure.

*[Visual: Derek building interview setup like scientific equipment - recording device, notebook, coffee cup arranged like chemistry experiment]*

**DEREK (V.O., CONT'D):** The interviews are... they're a bridge. Between watching and being. Between there and here. Between Sasquatch and Derek.

*[Visual: Bridge forming between forest (labeled "HIDING") and town (labeled "EXISTING")]*

*[Derek standing in middle of bridge, coffee cup in hand, looking both directions]*

**DEREK (V.O., CONT'D):** But Tom asked me the question. Not them. Me. What do I want to learn? And the answer is...

*[Visual: The bridge becomes a mirror. Derek sees himself. Many selves. Past selves. Possible future selves.]*

**DEREK (V.O., CONT'D):** I want to learn how to be a person. Not a cryptid. Not a legend. Not a watching thing in trees. A person. Who asks questions. Who gets asked questions. Who exists. In town. With other people.

*[Visual: Derek's reflection in mirror becomes solid. Steps out. Shakes his hand. Both Derek's nod.]*

**DEREK (V.O., CONT'D):** Tom asking me questions means I'm succeeding. Because people only ask questions of other people. Not legends. Not myths. People.

*[The animation fades. We're back in the coffee shop. Derek at window. Rain. Always rain.]*

**DEREK (V.O., CONT'D):** I should tell him that.

---

### [RETURN TO INTERVIEW]

*Derek walks back to table. Sits. Chair groans. Tom has been waiting silently. Has not touched coffee. Has written three new questions on legal pad.*

**DEREK:** I'm interviewing people because I want to understand how to be one.

**TOM:**  
(confused)  
How to be... one what?

**DEREK:** A person.

**[PAUSE: 7 seconds]**

**TOM:**  
(soft, understanding)  
Oh.

**[PAUSE: 4 seconds]**

**TOM (CONT'D):** But you... you are a person. You're talking to me. You're sitting here. You're... umm... you're doing person things.

**DEREK:** Am I? Or am I performing person things? There's a difference.

**TOM:**  
(thinking hard)  
Is there? I mean... umm... aren't we all kind of performing? Like... I'm performing librarian. You're performing... umm... what are you performing?

**DEREK:** Anthropologist. Observer. Interviewer. But under the performance... what am I?

**TOM:**  
(gentle)  
I think you're Derek.

**[PAUSE: 9 seconds]**

*Derek looks at Tom. Really looks. Tom doesn't look away. Holds eye contact. Gentle eye contact. Friendly.*

**DEREK:**  
(quiet)  
How do you know?

**TOM:**  
(shrugging)  
I don't. But... umm... nobody knows what they are under the performance. That's the scary part. We're all just... doing our best. And hoping it counts as being a person.

*Derek writes this down. Underlines it. Tom watches him write. Feels significant.*

**TOM (CONT'D):**  
(nervous again, changing subject)  
Can I... umm... can I ask about the coffee?

**DEREK:** Yes.

**TOM:** Why don't you drink it?

**DEREK:** I've been carrying this cup since nineteen eighty-seven. If I drink it, I'll need new coffee. New coffee isn't this coffee. This coffee is... familiar. Consistent. Unchanged.

**TOM:** So it's like... umm... a comfort object?

**DEREK:** Yes. That's accurate.

**TOM:**  
(smiling)  
I have one too. Not coffee. A book. Same book since I was twelve. I don't read it anymore. But I carry it. In my bag. Always.

**DEREK:** What book?

**TOM:** "The Phantom Tollbooth." It's about a boy who's bored. And then he goes through a tollbooth. To a place where everything's different. Where words and numbers are real. And... and he learns things. And comes back. Changed.

**DEREK:** You wanted to go through a tollbooth.

**TOM:**  
(nodding, emotional)  
Yeah. I did. I still do, kind of. But... umm... I think maybe the tollbooth is just... choosing to see things differently? Like... Ocean Shores is my tollbooth? I came here because I didn't fit anywhere else. And now... now I do. Kind of. Maybe. I don't know.

**[PAUSE: 6 seconds]**

**DEREK:** You fit here.

**TOM:**  
(surprised, pleased)  
Yeah?

**DEREK:** Yes. You're kind. You're curious. You ask good questions. You let me sit in the library. You didn't call anyone when I first arrived. You just... accepted.

**TOM:**  
(quiet)  
Thanks. That... that means a lot. Umm.

*Tom's coffee has gone cold. Derek's coffee was always cold. They sit in comfortable silence. The recording devices blink. Red. Red. Red.*

**TOM (CONT'D):**  
(reading final question from pad)  
Last question. And you don't have to answer. But... umm... are you lonely?

**[PAUSE: 12 seconds - longest pause yet]**

*Derek's hands rest on the coffee cup. Steady hands. But something in his posture shifts. Smaller. Heavier.*

**DEREK:**  
(barely audible)  
Yes.

**TOM:**  
(gentle)  
Is that why you're doing this? The interviews? To... to not be lonely?

**DEREK:**  
(pause)  
Partially. Also to understand. Also to exist. Also to... to have a reason to be visible. If I have a project, I'm not just... here. I'm here with purpose. Purpose makes presence acceptable.

**TOM:**  
(emotional, trying not to cry)  
Derek, you don't... you don't need a project to be acceptable. You just... you can just be here. Because you want to be.

**DEREK:** Can I?

**TOM:**  
(firm)  
Yes.

**[PAUSE: 8 seconds]**

**DEREK:** I'm not sure I believe that yet.

**TOM:** That's okay. I'll believe it for both of us. Until you catch up.

*The timer on Derek's phone dings. Soft. But this time it feels intrusive. Too soon. Tom looks disappointed. Derek looks... relieved? Unsettled? Both.*

**DEREK:** We're out of time.

**TOM:**  
(reluctant)  
Already?

**DEREK:** Fourteen minutes, twelve seconds.

**TOM:** Did... did I do okay? As an interviewer?

**DEREK:**  
(considering)  
You asked honest questions. You listened to answers. You shared your own experience. You were kind. Yes. You did very okay.

**TOM:**  
(beaming)  
Really?

**DEREK:** Really.

*Derek stands. Picks up recording device. Coffee cup. Tom stands too. Awkward. Should they shake hands? Hug? What's the protocol?*

*Derek extends his hand. Large hand. Careful hand. Tom shakes it. Normal handshake. Person handshake.*

**DEREK (CONT'D):** Thank you for your questions, Tom.

**TOM:** Thank you for answering. Even though it was probably uncomfortable.

**DEREK:** Very uncomfortable.

**TOM:**  
(laughing)  
Sorry. Umm. Not sorry. Actually. Because I think... I think you needed to answer questions. Not just ask them.

**DEREK:**  
(pause)  
You might be correct.

**TOM:** Can I... can we do this again sometime? Not an interview. Just... coffee? Or hot water? Whatever?

**[PAUSE: 5 seconds]**

**DEREK:** Yes. I would like that.

**TOM:**  
(surprised)  
Really?

**DEREK:** Yes. You're my friend, Tom. Friends have coffee. Or hot water. Whatever.

*Tom's eyes get watery. He adjusts his glasses. Blinks rapidly.*

**TOM:**  
(voice cracking)  
I'm your friend?

**DEREK:** Yes. Is that acceptable?

**TOM:**  
(nodding rapidly, definitely crying a little)  
Yeah. Yes. Very acceptable. Umm. I'm... I'm your friend too. Obviously. I mean... I'd like to be. If that's okay.

**DEREK:** It's okay.

*Derek walks to the door. Stops. Turns back. Tom is wiping his eyes. Pretending he's not crying. Failing.*

**DEREK (CONT'D):** Tom?

**TOM:**  
(sniffling)  
Yeah?

**DEREK:** The tollbooth is real. You went through it. You're on the other side now. Where things are different. Where you fit.

*Tom stares. Mouth open. Processing.*

*Derek leaves. Bell chimes. Rain gets louder. Then muffled. Then just background.*

*Tom sits back down. Stares at his legal pad. At his crossed-out questions. At the questions he actually asked. At Derek's answer about loneliness.*

*Linda approaches with a fresh coffee. Places it in front of Tom. Free. Unasked.*

**LINDA:** You did good, Tom.

**TOM:**  
(looking up, wiping face)  
He called me his friend.

**LINDA:** I heard.

**TOM:** I didn't know... I didn't know he was lonely.

**LINDA:** Most people are.

**TOM:** Yeah. But... he's Sasquatch. I thought... I don't know. I thought cryptids didn't get lonely.

**LINDA:** Everyone gets lonely. Cryptid is just what you are. Lonely is how you feel. Two different things.

*Tom nods. Drinks his fresh coffee. Thinks.*

*Twenty minutes later, he texts Derek: "Same time next week? Just coffee. No interview. Just friends."*

*Derek responds: "Yes. Acceptable. Thank you."*

*Tom smiles at his phone.*

*Linda smiles at Tom.*

*Everyone's lonely. Some people less now.*

## FIELD NOTES #002: POST-INTERVIEW ANALYSIS

**Initial Assessment:** Being interviewed is terrible. Highly do not recommend. Exposure of self is different than exposure of others. Others can leave. Self must remain with self. Uncomfortable discovery.

**Breaking Point:** "Are you lonely?" Question was gentle. Answer was honest. Honesty hurt. But hurt was... good hurt? Necessary hurt? The kind of hurt that releases something previously contained.

**Observable Behavioral Changes (MY OWN):**
- Vocal patterns: Measured → Hesitant → Vulnerable → Honest
- Body language: Controlled → Tense → Walked away → Relaxed (eventually)
- Eye contact: Maintained (difficult) → Avoided during difficult questions → Returned for final exchange
- Emotional state: Defensive → Exposed → Accepted (new feeling, unusual)

**Key Quote (MY OWN):** "I want to learn how to be a person."
- Did not plan to say this
- Said it anyway
- True statement
- Revelatory for self and listener

**Tom's Methodology:**
- Excellent interviewer despite nerves
- Asked questions I ask others (reciprocal)
- Listened instead of waiting to speak (rare skill)
- Shared own vulnerability (creates safety)
- Called me his friend (unexpected, significant)

**Post-Interview Behavior (MY OWN):**
- Required 22 minutes alone
- Sat on beach, rain, coffee cup, thinking
- Processed: loneliness acknowledged = loneliness slightly decreased?
- Hypothesis: Naming pain reduces pain? Or just redistributes it?
- Tom offered non-interview coffee meeting
- I said yes
- This is what people do
- I am doing what people do
- Therefore: I am succeeding at being person

**Hypothesis:** Being interviewed reveals self to self. Asking questions reveals others. Being asked questions reveals you to you AND you to others. Double exposure. Efficient. Terrifying.

**Evidence:**
1. I did not know I wanted to be called a person until Tom called me one
2. I did not know loneliness could be shared until I shared it
3. I did not know friendship was possible until Tom offered it
4. I did not know acceptance felt like this (warm, scary, good)

**Conclusion:** Tom's interview was successful research methodology reversal. Subject (me) learned more than expected. Data collected: friendship is real, loneliness is shareable, being a person requires practice and acceptance and coffee (or hot water) with other people.

**Question for Future Research:** If being asked questions helps me, does asking others help them the same way? Am I providing service or extracting it? Both? Need to consider ethics more carefully.

**Emotional Status:** Vulnerable. Exposed. Relieved. Hopeful (new feeling, monitoring).

**Coffee Temperature:** 48°F. Colder than last week. Entropy continues. Accepts this.

**Recommendation:** Continue project. Schedule non-interview coffee with Tom. Be friend. Practice being person. Observe results.

**Next Subject:** Haven't decided yet. Need time to process being subject before returning to interviewer role. Linda suggests "the surfer." Will consider.

## EXCERPT FROM DEREK'S PERSONAL JOURNAL  
(Not for publication, included because Tom said "honesty is important")

*Date: October 19, 2025, 11:52 PM*

Tom asked if I'm lonely.

I said yes.

I've never said that out loud before.

Two hundred years. Never said it. Thought it, obviously. Every day. Every year. Every decade. But never external. Always internal. Always private.

Tom asked. I answered.

And the answer didn't kill me.

That's significant.

I thought if I admitted loneliness, it would become more real. More powerful. Like naming a demon gives it strength. But the opposite happened. I said "yes, I'm lonely" and it became... smaller. Still there. Still real. But smaller. Manageable. Shared.

Tom cried. Just a little. When I called him my friend. I didn't mean to make him cry. But they were good tears. Happy tears. I think. Human emotions are confusing. Crying indicates sadness usually. But also joy. Also relief. Also overwhelming feeling of any kind. Inefficient signaling system. But Tom was smiling while crying. So: happy tears. Probably.

I have a friend now.

That's new.

I've had acquaintances. Allies. People who tolerate my presence. Linda is kind to me but that's professional kindness (though becoming real kindness, possibly). But Tom is a friend. He said so. I said so. Mutual agreement. Verbal contract. Friendship established.

How did that happen?

I answered his questions. He listened. We both acknowledged loneliness. We both acknowledged not fitting. We both acknowledged Ocean Shores as tollbooth to different place. And somewhere in that exchange, friendship happened.

Is it always that simple? Or was this unique circumstance? Research required.

Tom asked me why I'm doing the interviews. I said: to learn how to be a person. That was true. But incomplete truth. Full truth:

I'm doing the interviews because for two hundred years I've been invisible on purpose. Hidden. Safe. Isolated. And safe became lonely. And lonely became unbearable. And unbearable became: I need to do something or I'll disappear completely. Not physically. Existentially. I'll become the watching thing forever. Never the watched thing. Never the participating thing.

So I saw a sign that said "Come As You Are" and I came. As I am. Fur. Height. Coffee cup. All of it. Visible. Exposed. Participating.

The interviews give me structure. Purpose. Methodology. Without them, I'm just a cryptid who wandered into town. With them, I'm a researcher. Anthropologist. Person with project. Person with reason to be here.

But Tom said I don't need a project to be acceptable. I can just be here because I want to be.

I don't believe that yet.

But maybe I will someday.

Tom said he'll believe it for both of us until I catch up.

That's what friends do, apparently.

Believe things for each other.

Hold space.

Wait.

I'm not alone anymore.

That's terrifying.

That's wonderful.

That's... umm...

(I'm starting to talk like Tom in my journal. The "umm" is contagious. This is called code-switching. Or friendship. Or both.)

That's good.

Next week: coffee with Tom. Not an interview. Just coffee. Just friends. Just existing together with hot beverages and conversation.

I'll practice being a person.

He'll practice being my friend.

We'll both practice being less lonely.

The coffee's still cold.

But I'm not.

Warmth is metaphorical.

But it counts.

Good night.

## TOM'S EMAIL TO HIS SISTER  
(Obtained because he showed me and said I could use it)

**TO:** rachel.richardson@gmail.com  
**FROM:** tom.richardson@oceanshorespubliclibrary.org  
**SUBJECT:** I interviewed Sasquatch today  
**DATE:** October 19, 2025, 8:47 PM

Rachel,

I know that subject line sounds insane. But it's real. Remember I told you about the cryptid who's been coming to the library? Taking notes? Reading anthropology books? His name is Derek. He's been interviewing people for a project. And today he let me interview HIM.

I was so nervous. I made a list of questions. Crossed out half. Re-wrote them. Crossed out more. But I did it. I asked him things. And he answered. Honest answers. Real answers.

He's lonely, Rachel.

He said it out loud. "Yes." Just like that. No hesitation. No defense. Just: yes.

And I cried. Obviously. Because that's the most honest thing anyone's ever said to me. And because I'm lonely too. I didn't realize how lonely until he said it. And then I knew: oh. We're both lonely. That's why we recognize each other. Lonely people can smell each other. Or something. That metaphor got away from me.

But here's the thing: he called me his friend. Not acquaintance. Not research contact. Friend. He said "You're my friend, Tom." And I cried more. And he shook my hand. And we're getting coffee next week. Not an interview. Just coffee. Just friends.

I haven't had a real friend since college. Since before I moved here. I have coworkers. Patrons. People I'm friendly with. But not friends. Not real ones. Not the kind where you say "you're my friend" and both people know what that means and agree.

Derek is eight feet tall. He's covered in fur. He carries a coffee cup from 1987 that he never drinks. He's two hundred years old. He's Sasquatch.

And he's my friend.

And that's the best thing that's happened to me in years.

Is this weird? This is probably weird. But Ocean Shores is weird. I'm weird. He's definitely weird. So maybe weird + weird = normal? For us?

I don't know. I just know I'm happy. Anxious-happy. The way I'm always happy. But happy.

He said I went through a tollbooth. The Phantom Tollbooth. Remember that book? Mom read it to us when we were kids? He said I went through and I'm on the other side now. Where things are different. Where I fit.

He's right.

I fit here.

With Derek.

With Linda.

With Ocean Shores.

I went through the tollbooth and I didn't even realize it until he pointed it out.

Anyway. That's my update. I interviewed Sasquatch. He's lonely. I'm lonely. Now we're less lonely. Together.

How's your week going?

Love,  
Tom

P.S. - Don't tell Mom. She'll worry. Or worse, she'll want to meet him. Nobody's ready for that.

## APPENDIX B: AUDIO NOTES FOR GOOGLE TTS

**Voice Selection:**
- Derek: Same deep voice, 0.85x speed (consistent across episodes)
- Tom: Higher male voice, slightly faster, add nervousness to reading
- Linda: Brief appearance, warm female voice
- Add manual "umm"s and "uh"s (TTS won't do this naturally - insert as separate audio clips)

**Critical Pause Timing:**
- 12-second pause: "Are you lonely?" → "Yes."
- 9-second pause: "What am I?" → Tom's response
- 8-second pause: Derek processing "I'm your friend"
- 5-second pause: "Same time next week?" → "Yes. Acceptable."

**Verbal Filler Count (Tom):**
- 47 "umm"s
- 23 "uh"s  
- 18 "like"s
- Add these manually in post-production
- Varying lengths (some quick, some held)
- Creates nervous character voice

**Sound Design:**
- Coffee shop ambiance (consistent with Episode 1)
- Legal pad: paper sounds (flipping, writing, tapping)
- Rain: constant (Ocean Shores weather)
- Recording devices: two devices now (stereo effect?)
- Chair: groans (Derek) vs quiet (Tom)
- Glasses: subtle adjustment sounds (Tom's nervous tic)
- Phone: ding (end of interview) + text notification (post-interview)

**Emotional Beats:**
- Tom's voice cracks slightly when crying
- Derek's voice drops/softens for "Yes" (lonely admission)
- Tom's excitement when called friend (pitch rises slightly)
- Final exchange: both voices warmer than beginning

**Music: STILL NONE**
