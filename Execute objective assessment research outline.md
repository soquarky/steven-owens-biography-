 ## Defining Objective Assessment 
 
Objective assessment is a systematic evaluation process characterized by impartiality, clarity, and consistency in its criteria and scoring, thereby minimizing personal bias. Unlike subjective evaluations that rely heavily on individual judgment, objective assessments aim to measure an individual's knowledge, skills, or abilities using a predefined set of questions or tasks with clearly defined correct answers, such as multiple-choice or true/false questions . 
 
The core principles underpinning objective assessment are rooted in psychometrics, which emphasizes reliability, validity, and utility . Reliability ensures that an assessment consistently yields the same results under similar conditions, while validity confirms that the assessment accurately measures what it intends to measure . These principles are foundational to developing fair and unbiased evaluations, particularly in educational settings, where they are crucial for measuring student progress and achievement accurately .

### Context Dependency 
Objective assessments, by design, often simplify complex human attributes or performance into measurable components. This simplification can sometimes lead to a loss of contextual nuance. For instance, while a standardized test can objectively measure factual knowledge, it might not fully capture critical thinking or creativity, which are highly context-dependent skills. The challenge lies in designing objective measures that are sensitive enough to account for relevant contextual factors without reintroducing subjectivity. 
 ### Reductive Measurement 
The drive for objectivity can sometimes lead to reductive measurement, where only easily quantifiable aspects are assessed, potentially overlooking important qualitative dimensions. For example, in performance evaluations, focusing solely on numerical targets might neglect critical interpersonal skills or problem-solving abilities that are harder to quantify objectively . This can result in an incomplete or skewed understanding of an individual's true capabilities or performance.
