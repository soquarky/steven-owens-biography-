# Coffee with Sasquatch

**Book 1: Field Notes from Ocean Shores**

A comedy-philosophy hybrid about a 200-year-old Sasquatch named Derek who comes to Ocean Shores, Washington, and interviews the locals about being human.

## About This Project

Derek S. Bigfoot saw a sign that said "Come As You Are" and took it literally. Now he's conducting anthropological research by interviewing residents of Ocean Shores about what it means to be human. Armed with a coffee cup from 1987 (that he never drinks) and genuine curiosity, Derek explores loneliness, connection, and the absurdity of existence—one interview at a time.

## Format

Each episode combines:
- **Interview transcripts** with locals
- **Field notes** (Derek's observations)
- **Personal journal entries** (Derek's reflections)
- **External perspectives** (texts, emails from interview subjects)
- **Animation notes** for visual adaptation
- **Audio notes** for podcast/audiobook format

## Tone & Style

- **Genre**: Absurdist comedy meets existential philosophy
- **Influences**: Between Two Ferns, The Anthropocene Reviewed, Bo Burnham
- **Target Audience**: Adults 25-45 who appreciate honest, awkward humor
